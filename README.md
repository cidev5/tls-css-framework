## Why it's awesome

It's designed to be end-use agnostic, as far as opinionated styles go, and to fit right in with the latest front-end frameworks. Completely SCSS mixin based, it has no "reset", no classes. Use it in styled components. Use other libraries, normalize.scss, etc. Quick scaffolding. Officially supported by a total of two modern browsers. Try out the latest CSS has to offer now.
